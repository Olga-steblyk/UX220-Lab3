            <p>I recently went to the theaters with a friend and watched the<em> Barbie</em> movie. One fact about me is that I really love movies, especially silly ones, because sometime watching movies is about having a good time. 
            A few things that I would say about this movie would be.
            This film is something that was needed to be made. Sound track is tailored to this movie very well, and matches the energy with each scene. The cast performed incredibly and worked in sync with one another. Intro was perfect, captured attention almost immediately and what is sometimes missed in recent movies. With the plot, i feel that is had a few moments were it lost me, especially near the end but just like barbie...it hard to put an end to Barbie herself. It would be difficult to provide the movie with the most fitting ending but there is satisfaction with the movie itself. Personal favorite: the Ken fight/dance, schemeing to save Barbie land, talking to the creator herself, Ruth. One thing this movie does well to point out the cultural impact of Barbie, both positive and negative, I think that it was smart.</p>
